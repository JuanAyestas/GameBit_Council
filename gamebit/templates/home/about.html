        <p>Welcome to our page where we are interested in providing a place for people to interact and talk about games they want to talk about. We also post our opinions on different games from a variety of platforms (Xbox, Playstation, PC, and other platforms)</p>
        <p>We first started as a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/GameBitCouncil/">Facebook page</a> and we have a decent, still a bit small, community that's growing everyday and that motivate us to keep going!
        </p>
        <p>This webpage will be focused just to the review part, in the Facebook page we do both, meme-ing around, but also reviewing and sharing our opinions with all of you.
